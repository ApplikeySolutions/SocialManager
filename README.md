# Purpose

A reactive android library to easily implement social login (Facebook, Google, Twitter, Instagram) into your android project.

# Installation

```groovy
implementation 'com.github.applikey:socialmanager:1.0.0'
```

# Usage

### Configure app level gradle file:
```groovy
android.buildTypes.debug.manifestPlaceholders = [
        twitterConsumerKey   : "Set your twitter application consumer key",
        twitterConsumerSecret: "Set your twitter application secret key",
        googleWebClientId    : "Set your google application web client id",
        facebookAppId        : "Set your facebook application id",
        instagramClientId    : "Set your instagram application client id",
        instagramClientSecret: "Set your instagram application client secret key id",
        instagramRedirectUri : "Set your instagram application redirect uri"
]
```
If you don't need some social networks, leave fields empty, but don't remove.

### Configure your Application class:
```java
public class MyApp extends Application {
    @Override public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        Authentication.init(this);
    }
}
```
